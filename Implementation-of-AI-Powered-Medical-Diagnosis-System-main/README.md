# 🚀 **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System**

## 📌 **Overview**

An AI-powered **medical diagnosis web application** that predicts diseases based on user-inputted symptoms. Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive UI and **Python** for backend processing, this system leverages **machine learning models** such as **SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest** to provide real-time, accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ **Features**

✅ **🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction** – Classifies multiple diseases using trained machine learning models.  
✅ **🎨 User-Friendly Interface** – Built with **Streamlit**, ensuring an interactive, modern, and responsive design.  
✅ **⚡ Instant Diagnosis** – Displays real-time results with probability scores for better interpretability.  
✅ **📊 Data Visualization** – Integrated **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for feature analysis, correlation heatmaps, and prediction probabilities.  
✅ **☁️ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud** – Easily accessible and scalable for real-world usage.
