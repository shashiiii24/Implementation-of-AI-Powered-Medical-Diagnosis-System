# Implementation-of-AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System
# 📌 Project Overview
The AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist in medical diagnoses. It utilizes various machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to classify medical data and provide predictions based on input features. The application is designed to be user-friendly and is deployed using Streamlit for interactive web-based interfaces.

# Features
✅ 🩺 Multi-Disease Prediction – Classifies multiple diseases using trained machine learning models.

✅ 🎨 User-Friendly Interface – Built with Streamlit, ensuring an interactive, modern, and responsive design.

✅ ⚡ Instant Diagnosis – Displays real-time results with probability scores for better interpretability.

✅ 📊 Data Visualization – Integrated Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for feature analysis, correlation heatmaps, and prediction probabilities.

✅ ☁️ Deployed on Streamlit Cloud – Easily accessible and scalable for real-world usage.
